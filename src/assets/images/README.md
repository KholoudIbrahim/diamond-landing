# Assets Images

## Required Images

- `logo 1.png` - Main logo file used in the loading screen animation (150x150px recommended)

## Current Implementation

The loading screen component expects the logo to be located at `assets/images/logo 1.png`. If this file is not available, please place your logo file in this directory with that exact filename.

## Image Specifications

- Format: PNG with transparency recommended
- Size: 150px width (height will be auto-scaled)
- Background: Transparent for best results with the floating animation
